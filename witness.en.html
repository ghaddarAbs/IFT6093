(2915) Boz's [Juba] became a sensation in Britain for his dance style.</br>
(2916) Records next place [Juba] in both Britain and America in the early 1850s.</br>
(2917) His American critics were less kind, and [Juba] faded from the limelight.</br>
(2918) Prior to Juba's career, the dance of blackface performance was more faithful to black culture than its other aspects, but as blackfaced clowns and minstrels adopted elements of his style, [Juba] further enhanced this authenticity.</br>
(2919) By having an effect upon blackface performance, [Juba] was highly influential on the development of such American dance styles as tap, jazz, and step dancing.</br>
(2920) Dance historian Marian Hannah Winter proposed that [Juba] was born to free parents in 1825 or later.</br>
(2921) Showman Michael B. Leavitt wrote in 1912 that [Juba] came from Providence, Rhode Island, and theater historian T. Allston Brown gives his real name as William Henry Lane.</br>
(2922) According to an item in the August 11, 1895 edition of the "New York Herald", [Juba] lived in New York's Five Points District.</br>
(2923) In this environment, [Juba] learned to dance from his peers, including "Uncle" Jim Lowe, a black jig and reel dancer who performed in low-brow establishments.</br>
(2924) [Juba] was dancing for food and tossed coins by the early 1840s.</br>
(2925) Winter speculated that by about age 15, [Juba] had no family.</br>
(2926) Primary sources show that [Juba] performed in dance competitions, minstrel shows, and variety theaters in the Northeastern United States beginning in the mid-1840s.</br>
(2927) Documentation is confusing, as there were at least two black dancers using the name [Juba] at this time.</br>
(2928) An anonymous letter from 1841 or early 1842 in the tabloid newspaper the "Sunday Flash" states that [Juba] was working for showman P. T. Barnum.</br>
(2929) Beginning in the early 1840s, [Juba] began a series of dance competitions known as challenge dances.</br>
(2930) The time to decide that has come, as the friends of [Juba] have challenged the world to produce his superior in the art for $100.</br>
(2931) Then [Juba] made a loud strike with his left foot as the crowd cheered and he got a drink from the bar.</br>
(2932) [Juba] then traveled to Boston, billing himself as the "King of All the Dancers", and played for two weeks, with competitions versus Frank Diamond (no relation to John).</br>
(2933) [Juba] may have capitalized on the free publicity given him by Dickens as he made the jump from the saloon to the stage.</br>
(2934) In this performance, [Juba] imitated the white minstrel performers Richard Pelham, Frank Brower, John Daniels, John Smith, James Sanford, Frank Diamond, and John Diamond.</br>
(2935) Dancers came to recognize [Juba] as the best, and his fame soared.</br>
(2936) In 1845, [Juba] began touring with the Ethiopian Minstrels.</br>
(2937) From 1846, [Juba] toured with White's Serenaders, under the tutelage of Charles "Charlie" White, as a dancer and tambourine player off and on until at least 1850.</br>
(2938) With Boz's [Juba] as its newest member, the company toured middle-class theaters and lecture halls in the British Isles for the next 18 months.</br>
(2939) Writers from the period and later have generally identified Boz's [Juba] as the same person Dickens had seen during his visit to New York and who had danced against Diamond.</br>
(2940) Boz's [Juba] seems to have been a full member of Pell's troupe.</br>
(2941) [Juba] and Pell then joined the troupe headed by Pell's brother, Richard Pelham.</br>
(2942) [Juba] was the most written about performer in London for the summer 1848 season, no easy feat considering the large number of competitors.</br>
(2943) Dance historian Marian Hannah Winter argues that [Juba] was simply too talented to be held back.</br>
(2944) The few reviews of [Juba] as a solo performer after his tour with Pell (and thus out of the exhibitionist mode) are more negative.</br>
(2945) Scholar of African American studies Maurice O. Wallace adds that [Juba] was an example of how "those strategies of black cultural performance ... have historically coalesced to shape black masculine subjecthood in Eurocentric contexts".</br>
(2946) However, Wallace cautions that by the time [Juba] had reached London, he had "[transcended] the racial gaze" and was seen as a dancer first and black man second.</br>
(2947) In all the rougher and less refined departments of his art, [Juba] is a perfect master."</br>
(2948) The last known record of [Juba] places him at the City Tavern in Dublin, Ireland, in September 1851: "Boz's Juba appears here nightly and is well received".</br>
(2949) Dance historian Marian Hannah Winter said that [Juba] died in 1852 in London.</br>
(2950) More than 30 years later, theater historian T. Allston Brown wrote that [Juba] "married too late (and a white woman besides), and died early and miserably.</br>
(2951) In a note addressed to Charley White, [Juba] informed him that, when next he should be seen by him [White], he would be riding in his own carriage.</br>
(2952) Their entry suggests the name "Bois Juba" is a probable clerical error for "Boz's Juba", the sobriquet by which [Juba] was best known in England.</br>
(2953) Assuming all of the Jubas are the same person, the record suggests that [Juba] worked day and night for 11 years—from 1839 to 1850.</br>
(2954) Especially in his early days, [Juba] worked for food, and would have been served the typical tavern meal of the time, fried eels and ale.</br>
(2955) Playbills tell us, broadly, what [Juba] did during his performances.</br>
(2956) The more detailed accounts come from British critics, to whom [Juba] must have been more of a novelty than to Americans.</br>
(2957) [Juba] was described as a "jig dancer" at a time when the word still connoted Irish folk dancing but was in the process of changing to encompass black dance.</br>
(2958) [Juba] did three dances in two forms.</br>
(2959) A caricature of [Juba] shows him with knees bent and legs spread, one leg poised to land hard on the floor; arms in close.</br>
(2960) One British account, in an issue of "The Illustrated London News" from August 5, 1848, is accompanied by an illustration that shows [Juba] performing what seems to be a jig.</br>
(2961) Writers struggled to find words to describe what they saw [Juba] do.</br>
(2962) As a blackface minstrel, and thus parodist, [Juba] may have incorporated conscious parodies of such dances into his act.</br>
(2963) [Juba] seems to have presented varied styles at different tempos during a single performance.</br>
(2964) A London audience member who saw [Juba] at the Vauxhall Gardens wondered, "How could he tie his legs into such knots, and fling them about so recklessly, or make his feet twinkle until you lose sight of them altogether in his energy."</br>
(2965) [Juba] accompanied his dances with rapid-fire laughter synchronized to the tempo of the dance.</br>
(2966) [Juba] may very well have exuded Africa's cool aesthetic: composure and vitality.</br>
(2967) [Juba] was heir to the traditions of free northern black people, and Johnson has pointed to evidence that he was performing "a quite specific, African-infused plantation dance".</br>
(2968) Descriptions of his dance hint that [Juba] performed black steps such as the walk-around, the pigeon wing, a primordial Charleston, the long-bow J, trucking, the turkey trot, the backward spring, the wailing jawbone, and tracking upon the heel.</br>
(2969) [Juba] was in a white-dominated field playing for largely white audiences; he likely compromised his culture's music and dance in order to survive in show business.</br>
(2970) Dickens's piece on the New York dancer, describing leg movements only, points to the Irish jig, but he also refers to [Juba] performing the single and double shuffle, which are black-derived steps.</br>
(2971) Historian Robert Toll has written that [Juba] "had learned a European dance, blended it with African tradition, and produced a new form, an Afro-American dance that had a great impact on minstrelsy".</br>
(2972) Less happily, [Juba] reinforced the racist caricature of the naturally musical black among white audiences.</br>
(2973) For over 90 years after his death, [Juba] was largely forgotten by dancers and historians, appearing only in brief, racist passages in sources such as histories of minstrelsy.</br>
(2974) Stephen Johnson has postulated that this indicates that either white entertainers and historians consciously downplayed Juba's significance, or that [Juba] was simply not that influential.</br>
(2975) Winter was the first to write of [Juba] as a man who introduced elements of African dance to the Western lexicon and thus fostered the creation of a distinct American dance idiom.</br>
(2976) Winter's view that [Juba] was the "most influential single performer of nineteenth-century American dance" is now the consensus.</br>
(2977) Scholars in recent decades have repeatedly pointed to [Juba] as the progenitor of tap dancing and, by extension, step dancing.</br>
(2978) Dancer Mark Knowles has echoed this assertion, calling [Juba] "America's first real tap dancer".</br>
(2979) Scholars point to [Juba] as the first African American to insert aspects of authentic black culture into American dance and theater.</br>
(2980) In so doing, [Juba] ensured that blackface dance was more authentically African than the other elements of the minstrel show.</br>
(2981) Wallace has gone so far as to call [Juba] "the "pater alios" of black masculine dance history, and the 'initiator and determinant of the form itself,' a form which lends visible expression to the difficult dialectics of black masculinity".</br>
